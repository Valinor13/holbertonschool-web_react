Dashboard - React component
=============

The React component repository contains various states of progress in learning to use classes to manage state in the react app Dashboard, including a test suite using enzyme.

The first task of this project uses task_5 of the react props directory as a starting point. In this project we will convert most of our components to class compnents, and learn how to wrap components with HOC (higher order components). We also will convert some components to pure components so as to prevent uncessesary rendering.

1. Config folder contains the webpack config file and the Enzyme config for testing.
1. Dist folder contains the html, manifest, and icon image.
1. Src folder contains jsx, css, and image files for the application.
