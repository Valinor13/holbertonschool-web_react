Dashboard - React intro
=============

The React Intro repository contains various states of progress in learning to create my first react app, including a test suite using jest, chai, and enzyme.

The task_5 directory is the last step in the react intro. There we create our own webpack dev server with configuration for loading our jsx/css/image files.

1. Config folder contains the webpack config file and the Enzyme config for testing.
1. Dist folder contains the html, manifest, and icon image.
1. Src folder contains jsx, css, and image files for the application.

Installation
-----------

```
npm install
```

from the dashboard directory.

Usage
-----

To compile weback and launch local server:

```ruby
npm run start
```

To run tests:

```ruby
npm run test
```
