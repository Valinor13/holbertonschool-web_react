Dashboard - React props
=============

The React props repository contains various states of progress in learning to use props in the react app Dashboard, including a test suite using enzyme.

The first task of this project uses task_5 of the react intro as a starting point. By the end of the project we will add a new component, CourseList, as well as prop-types for prop consistency.

1. Config folder contains the webpack config file and the Enzyme config for testing.
1. Dist folder contains the html, manifest, and icon image.
1. Src folder contains jsx, css, and image files for the application.
